#Description : The project name is "Customer Management System" and it is built using the ASP.NET MVC core and Entity Framework. It implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database to manage customer information.

#Approach: The project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application's concerns into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which represents the user interface; and the controller, which handles user input and manages communication between the model and view. The Entity Framework is used to interact with the customer's database. This makes it easier to perform CRUD operations on the database without writing SQL queries directly.

#Features ##Home page : The home page of the application displays a list of all the customers in the database, along with options to create, edit, and delete customers.

##Create page : The create page allows users to add a new customer to the database. Users can enter the Customer's name, Customer's Ornaments, and  Weight of ornaments, Price of Ornaments, Customer's Phone number, Date of order, Date  of Delivery . ##Edit page : The edit page allows users to update an existing Customer's name, Customer's Ornaments, and  Weight of ornaments, Price of Ornaments, Customer's Phone number, Date of order, Date  of Delivery .  ##Delete functionality: The delete functionality allows users to remove a customer from the database.

##Details functionality: The details functionality allows users to display for a specific customer's details in the database by name.
